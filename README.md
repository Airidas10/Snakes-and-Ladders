Snakes and ladders game along with test classes developed in Java. 
My own implementation of a well known board game. I included some extra features, such as the ability to use a wildcard or a joker, which makes the game more tactical. 
I am aware, that the UI itself does not look too great (snakes are represented as arrows), but that was because I wanted to work with Java Graphics, instead of just uploading a picture and making it work.
Making this game was a great way to familiarize myself with the object oriented systems development.
